# SI 364 - F18 - Final Project

### DEADLINE: December 17, 2018 at 11:59 pm

## Overview
Your overall objective is to complete building an application that will allow you to search for restaurants via [the Yelp api](https://yelp.developers.com/), store all searches performed on the app, and allow users to register accounts and log in to save their own personal collections of restaurants. For each restaurant they add to the collection, users will also be able to add their own review and star rating.


For example, a logged in user could save several different restaurant collections with different names -- *Ann Arbor Restaurants*, *Favorite Chinese Restaurants*, whatever they want. For each restaurant in their collection, they can add a review and rating.
